Analyzing Response Time in M/G/1 Queues with Different Service Disciplines (30 marks)
In this assignment you will write a Python program, called response time analysis.py, that simulates an M/G/1/PS queueing system with unlimited capacity and outputs the mean and variance of the response time in addition to the mean of the slowdown. Recall that the slowdown of a job is defined as its response time divided by its size.
This program takes as input the name of a trace file in the current working directory and the processing speed of the processor-sharing server in bytes per second. The trace file is an ASCII file that contains multiple lines, each line describing the time that a job enters the queue, in seconds since the start of the trace, and its size in bytes. The format of this file is exactly the same as the trace file provided for Assignment 1, so every line is twenty bytes including the newline character, and arrival time and job size are separated by a number of space characters. Your program can read this file completely before the simulation starts.
Assume that the server does not remain idle when they are jobs in the system and that the simulation ends when all jobs run to completion and depart the system. When the simulation ends, your program must print out the mean and variance of the response time and the mean of the slowdown for all jobs that were processed by the server in the following format:
The output of your program must be exactly formatted as shown above. Your program will not be tested with input arguments that are not valid.
To analyze the performance of a given queueing system, you should use discrete event simulation as explained in Assignment 2. You must describe in a document, separate from your code, what data structure is used to simulate the queueing system with PS service order, how events are added, removed, or modified in this data structure, and the running complexity of your code.
To test your program you can use the packet trace file uploaded to eClass for Assignment 1 or create a new trace using the traffic generator you wrote for that assignment.
